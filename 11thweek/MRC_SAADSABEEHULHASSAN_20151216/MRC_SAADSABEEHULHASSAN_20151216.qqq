Q1. When does the system oscillates?
Ans.If there is an imaginary component to the root, then the system oscillates

Q2. When the system is not a BIBO stable?
Ans.If the real component of a complex root is positive, then the system is not BIBO stable 

Q3. What causes forever oscillation in a system?
Ans. Purely imaginary roots cause the system to oscillate forever
